Hello there! Thank you for supporting my work! :)

This is a small guide for you to understand part of the content of this environment:

1) You will find 2 Levels in "Content > ART > Levels". The "OverviewMap" level contains all the assets, and the GothicTemple level contains the environment example. 

2) Texture nomenclature is the following:

T_Name_AO (ambient occlusion)
T_Name_BC (base color)
T_Name_C  (curvature)
T_Name_H  (height/displacement)
T_Name_M  (metallic or mask)
T_Name_N  (normal)
T_Name_R  (roughness)
T_Name_NRAO (normal, roughness, ao)
T_Name_RMA (roughness, metallic, ao)
T_Name_RHA (roughness, height, ao)

The NRAO works this way: the Red channel has the Roughness, Green and Alpha channel have the Normal information and the Blue channel has the AO. You will find a Material Function called MF_NormalBlueChFix in those shaders who use this texture packing technique.

3) You will find that a few textures have the "Mip Gen Settings" set as "Sharpen10" or "NoMipmaps". I configured some of them that way to look better, but if you are consern about that, you can change that to the default value "FromTextureGroup".

4) If you want to read more specific about the rock, gothic assets or foliage shaders, you can check this post: https://80.lv/articles/gothic-temple-environment-breakdown
Here are a few videos of the environment and the how the shaders work:
